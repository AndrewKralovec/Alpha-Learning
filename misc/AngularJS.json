			"content":"<h1 style='text-align: center;'>Including angular scripts from</h1>The quickest way to get started is to point your html <code><span class='tag'>&lt;script&gt;</span></code> tag to a Google CDN URL. This way, you don't have to download anything or maintain a local copy.There are two types of angular script URLs you can point to, one for development and one for production:<ul><li><strong>angular.js</strong> — This is the human-readable, non-minified version, suitable for web development.</li><li><strong>angular.min.js</strong> — This is the minified version, which we strongly suggest you use in production.</li></ul><h1 style='text-align: center;'>Downloading and hosting angular files locally</h1>This option is for those who want to work with angular offline, or those who want to host the angular files on their own servers.If you navigate to <a href='http://code.angularjs.org/'>http://code.angularjs.org/</a>, you'll see a directory listing with all of the angular versions since we started releasing versioned build artifacts (quite late in the project lifetime). Each directory contains all artifacts that we released for a particular version. Download the version you want and have fun.Each directory under <a href='http://code.angularjs.org/'>http://code.angularjs.org/</a> includes the following set of files:<ul><li><strong><code><span class='pln'>angular</span><span class='pun'>.</span><span class='pln'>js</span></code></strong> — This file is non-obfuscated, non-minified, and human-readable by opening it in any editor or browser. In order to get better error messages during development, you should always use this non-minified angular script.</li><li><strong><code><span class='pln'>angular</span><span class='pun'>.</span><span class='pln'>min</span><span class='pun'>.</span><span class='pln'>js</span></code></strong> — This is a minified and obfuscated version of <code><span class='pln'>angular</span><span class='pun'>.</span><span class='pln'>js</span></code> created with the Closure compiler. Use this version for production in order to minimize the size of the application that is downloaded by your user's browser.</li><li><strong><code><span class='pln'>angular</span><span class='pun'>.</span><span class='pln'>zip</span></code></strong> — This is a zip archive that contains all of the files released for this angular version. Use this file to get everything in a single download.</li><li><strong><code><span class='pln'>angular</span><span class='pun'>-</span><span class='pln'>mocks</span><span class='pun'>.</span><span class='pln'>js</span></code></strong> — This file contains an implementation of mocks that makes testing angular apps even easier. Your unit/integration test harness should load this file after <code><span class='pln'>angular</span><span class='pun'>.</span><span class='pln'>js</span></code> is loaded.</li><li><strong><code><span class='pln'>angular</span><span class='pun'>-</span><span class='pln'>scenario</span><span class='pun'>.</span><span class='pln'>js</span></code></strong> — This file is a very nifty JavaScript file that allows you to write and execute end-to-end tests for angular applications.</li><li><strong><code><span class='pln'>angular</span><span class='pun'>-</span><span class='pln'>loader</span><span class='pun'>.</span><span class='pln'>min</span><span class='pun'>.</span><span class='pln'>js</span></code></strong> — Module loader for Angular modules. If you are loading multiple script files containing Angular modules, you can load them asynchronously and in any order as long as you load this file first. Often the contents of this file are copy&amp;pasted into the <code><span class='pln'>index</span><span class='pun'>.</span><span class='pln'>html</span></code> to avoid even the initial request to <code><span class='pln'>angular</span><span class='pun'>-</span><span class='pln'>loader</span><span class='pun'>.</span><span class='pln'>min</span><span class='pun'>.</span><span class='pln'>js</span></code>. See <a href='https://github.com/angular/angular-seed/blob/master/app/index-async.html'>angular-seed</a> for an example of usage.</li></ul>",

In this Assignment you have to exaplin how AngularJS brings tools and capabilities that have been available only for server-side development to the web client and, in doing so, make it easier to develop, test, and maintain rich and complex web applications."

I don’t have the space to describe JavaScript completely, but I have focused on the essentials that you’ll needto get up to speed and follow the examples in this book. In addition to the most important core JavaScript languagefeatures, I describe the set of utility methods that AngularJS provides."
